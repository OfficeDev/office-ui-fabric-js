#[Office UI Fabric JS](http://dev.office.com/fabric)

#####The JavaScript front-end framework for building experiences for Office and Office 365.

This framework uses styles from the [Office UI Fabric](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric/) project. Fabric is a responsive, mobile-first collection of styles and tools designed to make it quick and simple for you to create web experiences using the Office Design Language.

**Please note**: We are currently removing the core styles (colors, fonts, icons, etc.) from this project as they are part of the core [Office UI Fabric](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric/) project. If you have any issues related to these core styles, please open them in that project.
