# [Office UI Fabric JS](http://dev.office.com/fabric)

##### The JavaScript front-end framework for building experiences for Office and Office 365.

Fabric JS is a JavaScript front-end framework which provides visuals-focused [components](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-js/blob/master/ghdocs/COMPONENTSLIST.md) to extend, re-work and use in your Office and Office 365 experiences. Fabric JS uses styles from the [Office UI Fabric Core](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-core/) project. Fabric JS is a collection of responsive, mobile-first styles and tools designed to make it quick and simple for you to create web experiences using the Office Design Language. 

**Latest version:** Fabric JS 1.4.0, which uses [Fabric Core](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-core) 5.0.1.

## What's included
This repository contains simple, visuals-focused components that don't require a framework. For the entire list of components available in Fabric JS, see the [component list](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-js/blob/master/ghdocs/COMPONENTSLIST.md).

> **Note:** For more information on Office UI Fabric version 2.6.1, which combined Fabric core and Fabricâ€™s components together, see [Get started with Fabric 2.6.1](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-core/blob/master/ghdocs/V2GETSTARTED.md).

## Get started
For a quick start, you can reference the latest release of Fabric from a CDN or clone and build locally. Once you've got Fabric JS added to your project, look at the [component list](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-js/blob/master/ghdocs/COMPONENTSLIST.md) for documentation pertaining to each available component.

If you'd like to get Fabric through a package manager such as Bower, npm, or NuGet, check out the [package manager docs](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-js/blob/master/ghdocs/PACKAGES.md).

### Referencing the CDN
Include the following references in the `<head>` of your page:

```html

```

**Note:** You may notice an additional reference to the Fabric Core. The components of Fabric JS use styles from Fabric Core.

All [releases of Fabric JS](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-js/releases) are available on the CDN, with new versions typically added within a week of the release. To reference a specific version, update the version number in the URL to match the one you want.

If you want to reference previous versions, please see [this get started guide (located in the Core repo)](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-core/blob/master/ghdocs/V2GETSTARTED.md).

### Clone, build, and view the docs

Before you get started, make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), and [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed. To build Fabric:

1. Clone the repo
2. Navigate to the folder that contains the gulpfile.js file (Fabric JS's root).
3. `npm install`
4. `gulp watch`

The built files will be in the `/dist/` folder. You can then add these built files directly to your project.

You can also navigate to http://localhost:2020 to see the local docs site where you can test out the components' responsive behavior and see the samples.
